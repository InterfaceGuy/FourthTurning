# Fourth Turning (Saeculum) Cycle

The Fourth Turning, also known as the Saeculum cycle, is a generational theory proposed by William Strauss and Neil Howe. This 100-year cycle consists of four "turnings," each lasting about 20-25 years:

1. First Turning (High): A period of strong institutions and weakening individualism.
2. Second Turning (Awakening): A time of spiritual upheaval, when new values regime challenges the old order.
3. Third Turning (Unraveling): An era of strengthening individualism and weakening institutions.
4. Fourth Turning (Crisis): A period of destruction or revolution, when society focuses on reorganizing institutions.

Examples from recent American history:

- First Turning: Post-World War II boom (1946-1964)
- Second Turning: Consciousness Revolution (1964-1984)
- Third Turning: Culture Wars, Postmodernism (1984-2008)
- Fourth Turning: Global Financial Crisis and beyond (2008-present)

This cycle provides a framework for understanding generational changes in society and predicting broad social trends.
